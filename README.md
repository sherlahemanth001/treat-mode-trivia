This quiz app supports multiple players (n players). Each question has an x-second time limit, and a closing threat (e.g., fire or zone) intensifies over time. Players are eliminated if the threat reaches them. Points are based on the letter count of correct answers. A player wins by reaching a point threshold or meeting the time criteria.
